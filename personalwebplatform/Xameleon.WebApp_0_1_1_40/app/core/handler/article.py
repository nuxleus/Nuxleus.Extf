# Simplest handler you can have
# A handler is a class that defines the following
# methods. If one is not implemented it won't
# raise an exception, amplee will simply
# understand you don't have extra work to do
# for that particular type of request.
#
# Each member is the instance of its particular
# Member class as you can find in
# amplee.atompub.member.*
#
# To access the actual Atom entry you have to do the
# following call:
#
# member.atom
#
# Such as: member.atom.id.xml_text
#
# You can also raise a amplee.error.ResourceOperationException
# exception to stop the process and issue an HTTP error
# to the client. In that case the resource will not
# be persisted into the storage.
#
# Implement this handler as you see fit to add extra
# functionnalities to amplee for your specific
# requirements.
#
# For an example see:
# http://trac.defuze.org/browser/oss/amplee/amplee/examples/blog/core/handler/article.py
