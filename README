The original source of inspiration for the Nuxleus Project came from the work that Sylvain Hellegouarch and I did as part of what at the time was referred to as ExtensibleForge.NET, or Extf.NET. There was a lot of interesting pilot projects that were a part of the Extf.NET library and as such I felt it was important to integrate the original SVN repository into the Nuxleus Organization to bring back to life some of the innovative work we both spent a great deal of time working on during those early days.
